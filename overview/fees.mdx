## Gas Fees Covered

As part of our integration with Coinbase's wallet infrastructure, **Yield Seeker covers all Base network gas fees** using Coinbase’s paymaster system. This means all vault rebalancing, reward harvesting, and reallocations happen without eating into your returns. By minimizing friction and operational costs, we help ensure that your capital compounds efficiently and your actual yield matches what’s displayed.
