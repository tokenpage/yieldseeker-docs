## AI Powered DeFi

Yield Seeker is designed to make DeFi yield accessible and automated. With just a few steps, your AI agent takes over and continuously works to optimize your returns.

## Getting Started

To begin using Yield Seeker, simply connect your wallet, create an agent, deposit funds, and let the system handle the rest.

1. Connect your self-custodied wallet to the platform. Yield Seeker currently operates on the Base network and supports standard wallet integrations.

2. Create your personalized AI agent, give it a name and a symbol, in the background your own agent wallet will be created.

3. Deposit USDC into the agent wallet. Your funds are transferred into smart contracts controlled by the Yield Seeker platform—not your personal wallet—allowing the AI agent to manage your capital efficiently and securely.

4. From that point on, your agent operates autonomously. It continuously scans the ecosystem for the most promising yield opportunities and reallocates funds as needed to capture optimal performance.

## Autonomous Yield Optimization

After activation, your agent runs continuously in the background. It evaluates real-time data from top DeFi vaults on Base and dynamically adjusts your portfolio.

The AI considers various factors when reallocating capital, including annual percentage yields APY, available protocol incentives, risk-adjusted returns, and transaction costs. These decisions are made algorithmically, based on market conditions and the parameters you've set.

Unlike traditional yield vaults that lock your assets into a single strategy, Yield Seeker's agents are multi-vault by design. They shift allocations as the market evolves, ensuring that your capital is always positioned to take advantage of superior opportunities and quick to withdraw if you desire.

## Autoseek: Returns on Autopilot

Each Yield Seeker agent operates using our core strategy: **Autoseek**.

Autoseek is a fully autonomous strategy that actively rebalances your portfolio to maximize yield. As market conditions shift, your agent repositions your USDC across the best available vaults, ensuring that you're always earning competitive returns.

The strategy also auto-compounds your earnings. When reward tokens are issued by a protocol, Autoseek converts them into USDC at the most favorable market rates and reinvests the proceeds. This helps protect your capital from reward token volatility while compounding your base asset over time.

For example, if a vault pays out $50 in a volatile token, Autoseek will automatically swap that amount into USDC and reinvest it into high-performing vaults. This prevents value loss from token devaluation and keeps your capital growth consistent.

## Proven Performance

Yield Seeker’s Autoseek strategy is not only automated—it’s battle-tested. We’ve run rigorous back-tests across historical DeFi market data, simulating thousands of scenarios to fine-tune our agents' behavior. Autoseek has consistently outperformed static vault strategies by 4–8% annually.

This performance advantage stems from the agent’s ability to react to market changes in real time and transfer allocations across protocols. Where other platforms rely on single-strategy vaults, Yield Seeker adapts dynamically to shifting opportunities, preserving capital and enhancing yield.

Additionally, many competing platforms display inflated APYs by including high-risk, non-USDC tokens. These metrics can be misleading, as the tokens often depreciate quickly. Yield Seeker’s **Adjusted APY** accounts for this, discounting the value of unstable rewards to show you a conservative, reliable estimate of your real returns. The APY you see is the minimum you can expect to earn—not a best-case scenario.

## A Hands-Off Experience

Once your agent is live, there’s nothing more you need to do. Yield Seeker is designed to handle the complexity of DeFi yield generation so you don’t have to. Your AI agent executes the strategy, rebalances your portfolio, compounds earnings, and navigates market shifts—all automatically.

You can speak with the agent directly through the Discuss tab and ask it questions about its allocating your funds or dive deeper into the details of DeFi, but you don't have to either, the agent will simply take the appropriate actions on your behalf.

You remain in control of your capital at all times, while the agent ensures that your funds are always working for you.
