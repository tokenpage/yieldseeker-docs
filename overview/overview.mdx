## What is Yield Seeker?

Yield Seeker is an AI-powered yield allocation platform designed to help users maximize returns on their digital assets across top DeFi protocols. Users are given their own personal autonomous AI Agent, which continuously scans the ecosystem to identify optimal yield opportunities, taking into account APY, reward incentives, protocol risk, and liquidity depth.

Once funds are deposited, the agent intelligently reallocates capital across integrated protocols based on real-time market data and the userâ€™s personal risk preferences. 

Yield Seeker handles all strategy execution, transaction routing, and portfolio rebalancing, minimizing fees while maximizing capital efficiency.

With a focus on transparency, automation, and performance, Yield Seeker brings institutional-grade yield optimization to everyday DeFi users, all from a single, intuitive interface.
