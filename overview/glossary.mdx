## AI Agent

An autonomous, AI-powered strategy that manages your vault. The agent handles yield scanning, rebalancing, reward compounding, and transaction execution.

---

## APY (Annual Percentage Yield)

The annualized rate of return offered by a protocol, not accounting for compounding effects. Often used to compare raw yield across opportunities.

---

## Adjusted APY

A conservative estimate of yield that accounts for the volatility and potential devaluation of reward tokens. Yield Seeker converts all rewards to USDC to ensure this rate reflects actual returns.

---

## Autoseek

Yield Seeker’s default strategy. Autoseek monitors yield opportunities in real time, reallocates funds to top-performing vaults, converts reward tokens into USDC, and compounds returns—all automatically.

---

## Base Network

A Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum. Yield Seeker currently operates on Base, allowing for low-fee, high-speed DeFi transactions.

---

## Compound Interest

Interest earned on both your initial deposit and the interest that has already been accrued. This accelerates capital growth over time.

---

## EIP-7702

An Ethereum protocol standard used to delegate specific transaction permissions to your agent. Enables secure, gas-efficient execution without exposing your private keys.

---

## Lending Protocol

A DeFi platform where users can lend tokens (such as USDC) to earn yield from borrowers. Examples include AAVE, Morpho, and Compound.

---

## Liquidity Pool

A pool of assets deposited into a protocol that borrowers can access. Yield is generated for lenders based on demand for borrowing and protocol incentives.

---

## Rebalancing

The process of moving assets between vaults or protocols to capture higher yield. Yield Seeker agents rebalance automatically when doing so is cost-effective.

---

## Reward Tokens

Extra tokens distributed by some protocols as incentives for depositing assets. These are often volatile. Yield Seeker converts them to USDC to protect your returns.

---

## Smart Contract

A program deployed on the blockchain that runs autonomously. Yield Seeker interfaces with smart contracts through its agents without human intervention.

---

## Isolated Smart Account

An isolated contract-based account which the user's agent uses to control funds. Each account is scoped to a single user, and only that user can withdraw funds from it.

---

## TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)

A secure enclave used by Coinbase to store private keys. Yield Seeker uses Coinbase's TEE-based infrastructure to ensure keys remain encrypted, isolated, and inaccessible during operations.

---

## Total Value Locked (TVL)

The total amount of capital deposited into any given vault.

---

## Transaction Delegation

A process where your agent is authorized to act on your behalf via smart contract logic. You retain full withdrawal rights at all times.

---

## USDC

A widely used, dollar-pegged stablecoin. USDC is the only token currently supported by Yield Seeker for deposits and withdrawals.
