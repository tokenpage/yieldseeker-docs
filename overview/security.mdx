## Isolated Agent Architecture

Yield Seeker is designed with a strong focus on security, isolation, and user control. Each AI agent operates in its own secure smart wallet. These wallets are fully isolated from one another, meaning no agent can access or interfere with another agent’s funds. This structure ensures strict separation of user assets and prevents any cross-agent vulnerabilities.

Only the wallet owner has permission to withdraw funds. Yield Seeker never has custody of user assets and cannot move or access funds independently.

## Trusted Key Management

Private keys are stored using **Coinbase’s Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**. This infrastructure is designed to protect sensitive key material through encryption and hardware-based isolation. The TEE prevents unauthorized access to private keys, even from internal systems, and meets institutional-grade security standards.

## Smart Wallet Delegation via EIP-7702

Yield Seeker wallets implement **EIP-7702**, enabling secure transaction delegation without exposing private keys. This allows your agent to execute transactions autonomously while minimizing attack surface and maintaining robust key security.

Users can authorize transaction sessions without needing to sign every step manually, striking a balance between automation and safety.

## Full User Control

Users maintain full control of their funds at all times. Only the user can withdraw directly through the Yield Seeker interface at any point via the **Wallet** page.

In the unlikely event that the platform becomes inaccessible, you will still be able to withdraw your funds without the Yield Seeker app but you’ll need to contact us for assistance. We do not have access to your funds can help you recover them.
