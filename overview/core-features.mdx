## Infrastructure and Control

Yield Seeker is built on a custodial smart contract infrastructure that enables users to delegate capital to autonomous agents for high-performance yield generation. While the platform is not currently self-custodial, it is designed with transparency, operational clarity, and user control in mind. Withdrawals can be performed at any time.

Each agent is deployed within an **isolated smart account**, tied exclusively to the user’s wallet. These agents operate independently, ensuring that user capital is never pooled or exposed to other accounts.

## Autonomous Strategy Execution

Once activated, your personal AI agent begins scanning DeFi protocols on the **Base network** to identify optimal yield opportunities. It reallocates USDC across vaults that offer the highest risk-adjusted returns, taking into account:

- Real-time APYs
- Protocol and ecosystem rewards
- Transaction costs
- Liquidity depth and slippage

The agent acts continuously and autonomously, responding to market changes and rebalancing your portfolio when the net yield gain exceeds the cost of reallocation.

## Autoseek Strategy

Each Yield Seeker agent runs the **Autoseek** strategy by default. Autoseek automates every step of yield generation:

- Scanning and rebalancing across vaults
- Auto-compounding of earnings
- Converting volatile reward tokens into USDC
- Maintaining position in top-performing protocols

Autoseek is optimized for maximum growth, allowing users to benefit from continuous yield optimization with minimal friction or manual input.

## Reward Conversion and Token Consistency

Even when protocols issue rewards in volatile or alternative tokens, your agent will automatically convert them back to your original deposit token—typically USDC. This ensures that your vault balance is always denominated in the asset you chose, with no need to manually manage token swaps or track reward volatility.

## Performance Dashboard

All agent activity is tracked and surfaced through a **performance dashboard**. The dashboard includes:

- Live vault allocations
- Accrued and realized earnings
- Adjusted APY tracking
- Complete transaction history

Users can monitor fund activity in real time and execute a full withdrawal with just a couple of clicks.

## Talk to Your Agent

Through the **Discuss** tab, users can speak directly with their agent in real time. You can ask your agent what it’s doing, why it made specific decisions, or what factors influenced a reallocation. This ability to speak directly with your agent enhances transparency and gives you deeper insight into your portfolio’s behavior—without requiring technical expertise.
