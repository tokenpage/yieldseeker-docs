## Overview

Yield Seeker is built on a custodial smart contract infrastructure that allows users to delegate capital to autonomous agents for high-performance yield generation. While the platform is not currently self-custodial, it emphasizes transparency, operational clarity, and the ability to withdraw funds at any time. Each agent is deployed within an isolated smart account operated by a users personal AI agent.

Once activated, the agent continuously monitors DeFi protocols on the Base network to identify optimal opportunities. It reallocates USDC across integrated vaults that offer superior risk-adjusted returns, factoring in real-time APYs, protocol incentives, and transaction costs. When market conditions shift, the agent can rebalance funds or initiate asset swaps to maximize overall yield efficiency.

All fund activity is visible through an intuitive performance dashboard that provides real-time performance data, historical transaction logs, and comprehensive yield reporting. Users can track how their capital is being allocated and perform a full withdrawal with a couple clicks.

Each Yield Seeker agent runs the **Autoseek** strategy by default. Autoseek handles portfolio optimization, reward conversion, and compounding without user inputâ€”ensuring that capital is constantly working to achieve the highest possible return with minimal friction or complexity.
